# Day 18 – Shell Scripting: Functions & Slightly Advanced Concepts

## Task
Write cleaner, reusable scripts — learn functions, strict mode, and real-world patterns.

You will:
- Write and call **functions**
- Use **`set -euo pipefail`** for safer scripts
- Work with **return values** and **local variables**
- Build a slightly advanced script

---

## Expected Output
- A markdown file: `day-18-scripting.md`
- All scripts you write during the tasks

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Functions
1. Create `functions.sh` with:
   - A function `greet` that takes a name as argument and prints `Hello, <name>!`
   - A function `add` that takes two numbers and prints their sum
   - Call both functions from the script

### Task 2: Functions with Return Values
1. Create `disk_check.sh` with:
   - A function `check_disk` that checks disk usage of `/` using `df -h`
   - A function `check_memory` that checks free memory using `free -h`
   - A main section that calls both and prints the results

### Task 3: Strict Mode — `set -euo pipefail`
1. Create `strict_demo.sh` with `set -euo pipefail` at the top
2. Try using an **undefined variable** — what happens with `set -u`?
3. Try a command that **fails** — what happens with `set -e`?
4. Try a **piped command** where one part fails — what happens with `set -o pipefail`?

**Document:** What does each flag do?
- `set -e` → stop the code at error
- `set -u` → exit if a variable is unset
- `set -o pipefail` → print the error inside pipes

### Task 4: Local Variables
1. Create `local_demo.sh` with:
   - A function that uses `local` keyword for variables
   - Show that `local` variables don't leak outside the function
   - Compare with a function that uses regular variables
   - took help from gpt

### Task 5: Build a Script — System Info Reporter
Create `system_info.sh` that uses functions for everything:
1. A function to print **hostname and OS info**
2. A function to print **uptime**
3. A function to print **disk usage** (top 5 by size)
4. A function to print **memory usage**
5. A function to print **top 5 CPU-consuming processes**
6. A `main` function that calls all of the above with section headers
7. Use `set -euo pipefail` at the top

Output should look clean and readable.
